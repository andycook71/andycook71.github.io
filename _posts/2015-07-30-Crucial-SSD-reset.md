Turned on my Lenovo W540 with Crucial SSD in it the other morning and was confronted with an evil black screen - 


A power cycle of the SSD is done as follows, takes about ~1 hour to complete.
1. Power off the system.
2. Remove all power supplies (ac adapter then battery for laptop, ac adapter for desktop)
3. Hold down the power button for 30 seconds to close the circuit and drain all components of power.
4. Reconnect all power supplies (battery then ac adapter for laptop, ac adapter for desktop)
5. Turn on the system and enter the BIOS (see your manual for the steps to enter the BIOS)
6. Let the computer remain in the BIOS for 20 minutes.
7. Follow steps 1-3 and physically remove the SSD from the system by disconnecting the cables for a desktop or disconnecting the drive from the junction for a laptop.
8. Leave the drive disconnected for 30 seconds to let all power drain from it.
9. Replace the drive connection(s) and then do steps 4-8 again.
10. Repeat steps 1-4.
11. Cross fingers and start your computer normally and run Windows.

I was very surprised when it worked, having tried it once before a year and a half earlier  with no success. That time I had to do some horrible thing with connecting and disconnecting the power cable from a desktop PC.
